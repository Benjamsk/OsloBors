The OsloBors provides a list of all active stocks and their tickers in the form of a html table which we can get by following a given url. However, this html table is loaded via javascript, this means we cannot simply extract the html table using an html parser. The reason is because most html parsers, like beautiful soup, typically do not render javascript code. So we us a library selenium to open the url in the firefox browser, which does render javascript code. Then we extract the html from the broswer and use pandas to get extract our table and therefore our ticket list. \n",
